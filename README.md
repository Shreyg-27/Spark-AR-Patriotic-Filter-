# Patriotic Effect Filter 

*"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom."* 

We refer to our country as our motherland. She nurtures us and helps us grow. It is essential for one to possess the virtue of patriotism as it makes us better. 

The Patriotic filter shows 2 Indian flag masks on your cheeck along with "Jai Hind" on the top of the screen. It enables you to wear a white cap as well.
